            My name is Al Joshua Rollo, I am a student in the University of Saskatchewan in the College of Arts and Science Department of Computer Science.
            This website is a dedication to my road to become a web developer. As time passes, I will be adding more functionality and creativity to this
            website. I hope to display progress as the years go by.
